# Manual to setup vpn on Kali Linux

# This method described in [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q53n2ym_M4I)

## Copy DNS adresses from bottom in [opendns.com](https://www.opendns.com/)

Currently addresses are:
```
208.67.222.222
208.67.220.220
```
Pliz be careful. It can change

## Edit file /etc/resolv.conf by root rights

sudo su
vim /etc/resolv.conf

In resolv.conf:
Before:
```
# Generated by NetworkManager
nameserver 192.168.0.1
```

After:
```
# Generated by NetworkManager
# nameserver 192.168.0.1

nameserver 208.67.222.222
nameserver 208.67.220.220
```

## Next install vpn-soft from  [vpnbook.com](https://www.vpnbook.com/)

### For example from Russia I recommend open the site trough online [proxy](https://www.croxyproxy.com/) (if it bans your ip)

upload server file, for example:
Server: Download US1 Server OpenVPN Config Bundle

unzip this

## Finally start vpn by command below with input login and password from vpnbook.com 

openvpn --config vpnbook-us1-tcp443.ovpn

vpnbook
dmw3rcv

## Congrach! U hack the banning by locations and nations:)
